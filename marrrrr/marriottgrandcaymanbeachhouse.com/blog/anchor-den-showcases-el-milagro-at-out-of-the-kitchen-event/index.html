                <h1>​Anchor &amp; Den showcases El Milagro at Out of the Kitchen event</h1>

                
                <p>Anchor &amp; Den was thrilled to be involved in this week&rsquo;s Out of the Kitchen event, one of the highlights of Cayman&rsquo;s annual gastronomic calendar, which included fourteen of the island&rsquo;s best restaurants. The event was a big success with more than 250 guests in attendance. Chefs from each restaurant hosted their own table at the gala while cooking and serving an impressive menu tableside.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Taking inspiration from the vibrant street food scene of Mexico City and the nostalgic era of Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s masterpieces, Anchor &amp; Den proudly showcased its newest culinary concept, El Milagro &ndash; &ldquo;The Miracle.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We were fascinated by the&nbsp;colourful&nbsp;street food culture of Mexico, where locals buy their meals from market stalls, small trucks, pushcarts and even off bicycles. Throw in the pop culture visuals of Lucha Libre, Mexico&#39;s iconic masked superheroes, and you have a playful vibe with inventive food and funky mezcal cocktails to match.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As with the years before, Anchor &amp; Den really stood out with its stylish table d&eacute;cor and tastefully clad servers. Every detail fully embraced the Mexicano theme and included colorful lights, nature-inspired centerpieces as well as mini vintage photographs of Luche Libre and Frida Kahlo. We even took our branding one step further by inviting female guests to the Braid Bar at a nearby salon to get a Frida-inspired &lsquo;do in preparation for the event!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Besides the vibrant atmosphere and beautiful company, who could forget to mention the outstanding food? The culinary team at Anchor &amp; Den really outdid themselves this year by offering a huge selection of authentic, fresh and simple dishes. Our version of classic antojitos (&ldquo;little cravings&rdquo;) included a mosaic of exciting and unexpected plates serving Lion Fish Flamb&eacute;, Short Rib Mole and Ground Chuck Tamales, plus so much more.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Among the familiar faces of the local community that were invited to join our table, many of Cayman&rsquo;s media influencers were part of the Anchor &amp; Den group. Maya Lewis, Marketing Manager at Active Capital Ltd and well-known local blogger <a href="http://www.caribbeansnowflake.com">Caribbean Snowflake</a>, was looking forward to the event all week. She said: &ldquo;Anchor &amp; Den pulled out all the stops and left no stone unturned in their quest to deliver an unforgettable culinary experience to their guests &ndash; and they absolutely succeeded on every level. The vibrant table d&eacute;cor, energetic waiters and delicious food gave us an authentic taste of Mexico. Each small plate was completely different from the last and alive with flavour &ndash; it was simple food with a surprising twist, like the zesty chunks of fresh mango with chili and lime which served almost as palette cleanser between bites of fresh tortillas filled with all sorts of delights such as crispy octopus and juicy steak. I loved the imaginative cocktails which were crafted by the genius bartenders right at our table and just when I thought it couldn&rsquo;t possibly get any better, we were presented with a box of incredible handmade chocolates which were works of art in themselves &ndash; themed, of course! If you like Mexican food you&rsquo;re going to LOVE El Milagro. Anchor &amp; Den you had me at &ldquo;Taco&rdquo; &ndash; thanks for a fabulous evening!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Ted Green, Founder of Ted Green Fragrances, commented: &ldquo;The event was an experience of culinary excellence. A fantastic opportunity to meet-n-greet many of Cayman&#39;s unsung culinary superheroes, many of whom would once again delight our taste buds by cooking authentically inspired Mexican themed meals. I lost count after the 5th or 6th serving. Having been seated at the most festive table in the house, Anchor &amp; Den exceeded my every expectation. With a decor as imaginative and authentic as the food, I felt like I was one of the night&#39;s winners. Congrats to all of the culinary award winners, finalists and people who cook for the community everyday. We loooove you!&rdquo;<br />
