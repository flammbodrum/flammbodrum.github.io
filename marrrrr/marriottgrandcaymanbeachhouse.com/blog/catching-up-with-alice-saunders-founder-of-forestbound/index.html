                <h1>Catching up with Alice Saunders, Founder of Forestbound</h1>

                
                <p><em>Introducing Alice Saunders, Founder and Maker of Forestbound</em><br />
<br />
At our Beach House, we are gearing up for the first edition of The Night Market, an exciting collaboration between Anchor &amp; Den and The Mercantile, taking place this Friday, June 15th. We will be featuring yummy street food stalls, live music and lots of retail inspiration just in time for Father&rsquo;s Day!<br />
<br />
We are also super stoked that Alice Saunders from <a href="https://www.forestbound.com/">Forestbound</a> will be joining us. Her fabulous &lsquo;Grand Cayman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Endless Summer&rsquo; canvas bags have been a huge hit with both our international guests and the local community. They have been flying off the shelves at the Mercantile! On the night, Alice will be taking over one of our retail stalls, bringing some exclusive Forestbound items and offering a complimentary monogramming service for guests who have purchased one of her bags from our shop.<br />
<br />
We were able to catch up with Alice before her first trip to Cayman. Read on to hear more!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We asked Alice to tell us the story of Forestbound and what her inspiration was for creating this wonderful company. She told us: &ldquo;To be honest, Forestbound kind of happened by accident! About 10 years ago I decided to sell the canvas and leather handbags that I was making on the side while working 2 full time jobs and people loved the bags so much that it quickly turned into a thriving full time business. I&rsquo;ve always loved sewing and working with my hands and to have it now be my full time job is something that I am thankful for every single day.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We love teaming up with Forestbound! When asked why Alice enjoys partnering with our Beach House brand, she spoke about her covetable Escape Bag collection. She elaborated: &ldquo;When people see the Escape bag, I hope it inspires them to immediately plan a getaway to a special place that evokes a feeling of peace and calm &ndash; and this is exactly what the Grand Cayman Marriott offers to their guests! With my bags and the feeling of escape that they evoke, I hope to help people to unplug and bask in that endless summer feeling and I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better partner to help make this come to life than Grand Cayman Marriott.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When we asked Alice what her vision of a perfect summer escape is, she fondly explained: &ldquo;A weekend at my cabin with friends and my dog. Lots of canoeing, hiking, swimming, and gathering around the fire with wine.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Last but not least, we asked Alice what bag or accessory is her trusted traveling companion. She concluded: &ldquo;My go-to is always the Forestbound Grand Cargo Bag - it&rsquo;s oversized and durable in the best of ways. It&rsquo;s the perfect bag to just throw everything in and go (and I mean everything - this bag can hold A TON!).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Alice in a Nutshell:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
What is your motto? Take it Easy :)&nbsp;<br />
Brand of sunscreen - Glossier<br />
Sunset drink - Margarita<br />
Summer scent - Rose 31 by LeLabo<br />
Brand of sunglasses - Carla Color&nbsp;<br />
Summer Book - I am so busy running Forestbound I barely have time to read these days so I&rsquo;m still on last summer&rsquo;s book, Sweetbitter by Stephanie Danler<br />
Song of the season&nbsp; - can&rsquo;t stop listening to Fast Slow Disco by St. Vincent&nbsp;<br />
Flips flops or bare feet - Bare feet!<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Meet Alice and hear all about her amazing story (as well as check out all her fabulous Forestbound products!) at this Friday&rsquo;s Night Market, taking place at Anchor &amp; Den from 6pm. We can&rsquo;t wait to see you there!</em></strong></p>
