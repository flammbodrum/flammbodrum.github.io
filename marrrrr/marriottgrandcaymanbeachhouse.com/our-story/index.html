              <p>Is all about bringing you back to that summer state of mind. Because it isn’t just a season – summer is a way of life. For a comprehensive programme on the latest happenings at our Beach House, we welcome you to download our Experience Guide, where you can read all about this month's Food &amp; Beverage offerings as well as our Recreational and Kids Club activities.</p>

              <h2>relax &amp; reconnect</h2>
              <p>
                We know that finding the idyllic spot to relax and reconnect is a major part of the ultimate Beach House Experience. Your vacation starts the moment you set foot on the powdery white sand of Seven Mile Beach. Our Beach &amp; Pool Ambassadors are there to help you find the perfect place to unwind and enjoy your day by the sea. Once you are situated, they will offer you freshly pressed towels and help you set up your sun lounger and umbrella. They will even re-position your umbrella so that you always have shade. Plus, if you decide you want a bite to eat or drink, they will offer snacks and cocktails that you can savour from your beach chair. We also have a dedicated Sunglasses Concierge who will make sure that your sunglasses are smudge and sand-free. Let us pamper you!

              <h2>SUN BURN RELIEF STATION</h2>
              <p>At our Beach House, the signature scent is sun tan lotion – a delicious blend of tropical, fruity and coconut smells that evoke the feeling of summer. This fragrance always takes us back to that perfect moment on the beach, with the soft white sand at your fingertips and the view of the sparkling turquoise ocean playfully calling you in. This is what summer is all about!
                <br>
                <br>
              Sunscreen is a staple at our resort but even with the best intentions, it is so easy to lounge on the beach all day long and soak in just a little too much sun. We encourage you to take advantage of our Sun Burn Relief Station located near the entrance to the pool and beach (close to the Towel Hut). Natural remedies such as cold towels, freshly cut cucumber and Aloe Vera leaves can help relieve sunburns while local, organic and paraben-free skincare products can help soothe and moisturise skin.</p>

              <h2>EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL</h2>
              <p>
                Inspired by the French bicycle design of the 50’s and 60’s, Linus bikes preserve the simple elegance and pure form of that golden era, but have all the benefits of modern comfort and reliability. Take the opportunity to enhance your experience by exploring what this charming island has to offer.

              <h2>AROUND THE ISLAND</h2>
              <p>One of the most enjoyable ways you can spend a beautiful breezy morning in Grand Cayman is by discovering the island by bicycle. We were inspired by memories of riding along through the picturesque countryside with loved ones during our own vacation experiences and wanted to re-create these special moments for our guests by offering Linus bike rentals, which is covered by the Resort Fee.

              <h2>SUNSET RITUAL</h2>
              <p class="lead">“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.” – Marcel Proust
              </p>
              <p>There is just something magical about watching the sunset. It is one of those few moments during the day that grounds you and makes you feel a part of something. Experiencing a sunset reminds you that even the simplest things in life can be the most inspirational.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is profound to think that humanity has been witnessing the sunset for thousands of years. It is such a predictable act of nature but we are still mesmerized and transfixed on that image as the sun makes its decent into the horizon, knowing that you could miss its final moments with a mere blink of an eye.
                <br>
                <br>
                What thoughts go through your mind when you watch the sunset? Do you assess all the accomplishments or of your day? Do you think about loved ones who you wish were with you at that instant? Or do you not think of anything at all and just release your mind to the serenity of the moment?
                <br>
                <br>
                At our Beach House, we love to make a ritual out of the breathtaking Cayman sunset. We set up distinctive furniture right on the beachfront at the end of the day so you have the perfect backdrop to take pictures as the sun goes down.
                <br>
                <br>
                Join us for our Sunset Ritual; it is a signature event that is not to be missed.
